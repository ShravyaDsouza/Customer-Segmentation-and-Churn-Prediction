# Customer Segmentation & Churn Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a series of projects focused on **Customer Segmentation** and **Churn Prediction** across various industries. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand the different groups of customers they serve, while churn prediction identifies customers who are likely to leave. Both tasks are crucial for creating targeted marketing strategies and improving customer retention.

Each subfolder in this repository is dedicated to a specific industry, showcasing how segmentation and churn prediction techniques can be applied across different domains. The projects include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models such as K-Means for segmentation and classification algorithms for churn prediction.

## Data Sources

The datasets used in this repository vary by industry.Each project's README.md provides specific details about the dataset and attributes.

## Projects Included

1. ### Online Retail: 
Customer Segmentation & Churn Prediction based on the Online Retail II dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to perform customer segmentation and predict churn across various industries by applying different machine learning algorithms to extensive datasets. Each project showcases how to analyze customer data, group customers into meaningful segments, and predict which customers are likely to churn, enabling businesses to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer retention.
